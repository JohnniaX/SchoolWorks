## Question 1

Consider the validation set approach, with a 50/50 split into training and validation sets

(a) Suppose you perform the validation set approach twice, each timme with a different random seed. What is the probability that an observation, chosen at random, is in both of those training sets?

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
    P(\text{in training set 2}|\text{in training set 1}) &= P(\text{in training set 2}) \cdot P(\text{in training set 1})\\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  
(b) If you perform the validation set approach repeatedly, will you get the same result each time? Explain your answer.
