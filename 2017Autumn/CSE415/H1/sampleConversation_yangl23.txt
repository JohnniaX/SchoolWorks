0A: Tony Stark: My name is Tony Stark. My armor was never a distraction
    or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now I'm a changed
    man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and
    toys. But one thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man
    I was programmed by Chongyi Xu. If you don't like
    me, contact him at chongyix@uw.edu or directly to Marverl.
   How can I help you?

0B: Siri: Ni Hao, this is Siri! I am the absolutely
     capable to solve everything, no matter it is about 
     music and art, or physics and biology. No other human 
     can beat me! But I hate teaching other person. I like 
     basketballs and I am a challenger tier LOL player. If 
     you have some more information and would like me to 
     know and learn, please email me at yangl23@uw.edu. 
     Come and let's chat!
