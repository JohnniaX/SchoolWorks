1. We will perform k-nearest-neighbors in this problem, in a setting with 2 classes,
25 observations per class, and p = 2 features. We will call one class the "red"
class and the other class the "blue" class. The observations in the red class
are drawn i.i.d. from a $N_p(\mu_r, I)$ distribution, and the observations in the blue
class are drawn i.i.d. from a $N_p(\mu_b, I)$ distribution, where r =

0
0

is the
mean in the red class, and where b =

1:5
1:5

is the mean in the blue class.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
