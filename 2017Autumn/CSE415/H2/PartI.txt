1. For each of the following, determine which of the two relations \subsetof" or \element-of" is being
represented, and reformulate the statement to make this clearer. The first one is done for you. If you
find genuine ambiguity in a statement, justify each of the possible interpretations.
	a. Fido is a dog
	Fido \element-of dogs
	b. A parrot is a bird
	parrot \subsetof birds
	c. Polly is a parrot
	Polly \element-of parrots
	d. David Jones is a Jones
	David Jones \element-of Jones
	e. George Washington's a great name
	George Washington \element-of names
	f. Artifcial Intellengence is a state of mind
	Artificial Intellengence \subsetof state of minds

2. For each of the following relations, state whether or not it is re
exive, whether or not it is symmetric,
whether or not it is transitive, whether or not it is antisymmetric, and whether or not it is a partial
order. For each example, let the set S on which the relation is defined be the set of elements mentioned
in that example.
	a. {(a, a)}
	Reflexive, antisymmetric, symmetric and transitive. So it is partial order.
	b. {(a, b), (a, c), (b, c)}
	Antisymmetric only.
	c. {(a, b), (b, c)} 
	Antisymmetric only.
	d. {}
	Reflexive, antisymmetric, symmetric and transitive. So it is partial order.
